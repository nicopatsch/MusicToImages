# MusicXML processing program


### Print song frequencies

Use `python printSong.py [song-title]` in your terminal in this folder to print the content of the song as frequencies.
The title of the song should be the name of your musicxml part file without the extension.

The program will print the frequencies to the terminal and save them in the "txt" folder.
This can be use as such in [the SongSim program](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/).


### Get song similirarity matrices

Use `python saveSong.py [song-title]` in your terminal in this folder to print the song's similarity matrices.
The title of the song should be the name of your musicxml part file without the extension.

The program will save the images in the "PNG" folder.


### ENJOY!
